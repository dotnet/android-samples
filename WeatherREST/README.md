WeatherREST
===========

This sample app accompanies the article, 
[Call a REST Web Service](http://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/android/web_services/consuming_services/call_a_rest_web_service/).
You can use this sample to learn how to call a RESTful service via 
HTTP and handle/parse the JSON results asynchronously. 

This example app sends latitude and longitude information in an HTTP 
request (to *Geonames.org*) and gets back weather information for that 
longitude and latitude. The user keys in the global latitude and 
longitude parameters and then presses **Get Weather**. When the HTTP 
response is received, the app parses the results and displays a subset 
of the weather information in textbox fields in the lower half of the 
display:

This example uses `System.Json` to parse the results of the HTTP 
request. The HTTP request, response, parsing, and display are handled 
asynchronously via `async`/`await`. 

Note that this sample uses a geonames.org demo account, which supports 
a limited number of accesses. If the display is not reporting weather 
information, check your IDE output window to view the HTTP response and 
see if it contains a "daily limit has been exceeded" message. 

You will need an Android device or emulator with a large screen (such as 
a Nexus 5 or an AVD with the WXGA720 skin) to view the results.
