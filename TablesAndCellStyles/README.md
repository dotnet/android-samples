Table and Cell Styles
=====================

This sample illustrates Android's built-in ListView styles and some customizations that are possible.

One of the Activities - Screens/CustomTables/CustomFastScroll - requires API level 11. 
You can set the API level in the Project Properties. You must also uncomment the "CustomFastScroll" style
in Resources/Values/Styles.xml (since that will not build on earlier versions).
