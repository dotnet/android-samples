	/**
 	* Launcher Activity that demonstrates the use of runtime permissions for Android M.
 	* It contains a summary sample description, sample log and a Fragment that calls callbacks on this
 	* Activity to illustrate parts of the runtime permissions API.
 	* <p>
 	* This Activity requests permissions to access the camera ({@link android.Manifest.permission#CAMERA})
 	* when the 'Show Camera' button is clicked to display the camera preview.
 	* Contacts permissions (({@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_CONTACTS} and ({@link
 	* android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_CONTACTS})) are requested when the 'Show and Add Contacts'
 	* button is
 	* clicked to display the first contact in the contacts database and to add a dummy contact
 	* directly to it. Permissions are verified and requested through compat helpers in the support v4
 	* library, in this Activity using {@link ActivityCompat}.
 	* First, permissions are checked if they have already been granted through {@link
 	* ActivityCompat#checkSelfPermission(Context, String)}.
 	* If permissions have not been granted, they are requested through
 	* {@link ActivityCompat#requestPermissions(Activity, String[], int)} and the return value checked
 	* in
 	* a callback to the {@link android.support.v4.app.ActivityCompat.OnRequestPermissionsResultCallback}
 	* interface.
 	* <p>
 	* Before requesting permissions, {@link ActivityCompat#shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(Activity,
 	* String)}
 	* should be called to provide the user with additional context for the use of permissions if they
 	* have been denied previously.
 	* <p>
 	* If this sample is executed on a device running a platform version below M, all permissions
 	* declared
 	* in the Android manifest file are always granted at install time and cannot be requested at run
 	* time.
 	* <p>
 	* This sample targets the M platform and must therefore request permissions at runtime. Change the
 	* targetSdk in the file 'Application/build.gradle' to 22 to run the application in compatibility
 	* mode.
 	* Now, if a permission has been disable by the system through the application settings, disabled
 	* APIs provide compatibility data.
 	* For example the camera cannot be opened or an empty list of contacts is returned. No special
 	* action is required in this case.
 	* <p>
 	* (This class is based on the MainActivity used in the SimpleFragment sample template.)
