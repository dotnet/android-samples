Built In Views
==============

This sample is part of the Android ListViews and Adapters series; it includes
two projects that illustrate built-in ListViews. Note: to use SimpleSelectableListItem, SimpleListItemActivated1, or SimpleListItemActivated2, you need API level 11 or higher.

For more about built-in ListViews (and to view screenshots from this sample), see the accompanying article [ListViews and Adapters, Part 3 - Customizing a ListView's Appearance](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/user_interface/working_with_listviews_and_adapters/part_3_-_customizing_a_listview's_appearance).
