How to build the entire package from source
===========================================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Android SDK.
  - Environment variable ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/the/sdk
  - Environment variable PATH must contain $ANDROID_HOME/tools
- Oracle JDK 1.6. To generate supported format of JavaDoc you cannot use 1.7.
- Gradle (verified build with 1.6).
  - Maven build task depends on its existence in your PATH.
- Apache Ant to build the library project zip.
- Apache Maven 3.0 to build the library in its own manner and then Javadoc.

Build steps
-----------

Download ActionBarSherlock v4.4.0 from github:
https://api.github.com/repos/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock/zipball/4.4.0

Extract it under this directory.

Go to JakeWhatron-ActonBarSherlock-whatever directory.

Edit pom.xml and replace <version>3.5.3</version> with
<version>3.8.0</version>.
(seealso http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17293940/)

Run: mvn verify javadoc:aggregate-jar

Go to actionbarsherlock dir.

Run the following commands:

	android update project -p .
	ant debug
	zip -r ActionBarSherlock-4.4.0.zip bin/classes.jar bin/AndroidManifest.xml res 

Copy ActionBarSherlock-4.4.0.zip to ../../ActionBarSherlock/Jars
(Note that "../.." is *this* directory)

Edit ActionBarSherlock/ActionBarSherlock.csproj and look for <JavaDocPath>
and ensure that the path specicifed there exists and points to API reference.
It might give different path (especially JakeWharton-whatever hash part).

(The API Reference is generated by Maven, and it is important to provide
parameter names).
