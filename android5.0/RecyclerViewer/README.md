# RecyclerViewer

This sample app accompanies the articles
[CardView](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/user_interface/cardview) and
[RecyclerView](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/user_interface/recyclerview).
You can use this sample to learn how to use the new `CardView` and `RecyclerView` widgets
introduced with Android 5.0 Lollipop.

This app is a simple "Photo Album Viewer" that lets the user scroll up 
and down to view a collection of photos. Each photo, which consists of 
an image with caption text, is displayed as a row item in the 
`RecyclerView`. The <span class="uiitem">Random Pick</span> button 
randomly swaps a photo in the collection with the first photo to 
demonstrate how `RecyclerView` is updated when the data set changes. 
When the user taps a photo, a toast appears to display the number of 
the photo within the collection &ndash; this demonstrates how item view 
click handlers work. 

Each image/caption (photo) row item is displayed in a `CardView` 
layout, and the app uses a single `RecyclerView` layout to hold and 
display over thirty unique row items. An *adapter* is used to connect 
the `RecyclerView` with a simple "Photo Album" database, a 
*view-holder* is used to cache view references, and a linear *layout 
manager* positions the `CardView` row items within the `RecyclerView`.
