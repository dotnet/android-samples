# ActivitySceneTransitionBasic
This sample demonstrates how to the use Activity scene transitions when transitioning from one activity to another. Uses a combination of moveImage and changeBounds to nicely transition from a grid of images to an activity with a large image and detail text.

## Instructions
* Touch each photo to activate a transition to a details page for each one.
* Hitting the back button will activate a transition back to the grid of photos.

## Build Requirements
This sample requires Xamarin.Android 4.17 or later and an Android L or later device.
