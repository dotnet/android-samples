How to build the entire package from source
===========================================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Xamarin.Android 4.7.x is the verified version that runs the samples.
  At least samples won't build as those ported code contains some newly
  bound API that did not exist in 4.6.x (it is not hard to remove them).

Build steps
-----------

- Create "urbanairship-sdk" directory, then download Urban Airship
  Android SDK v3.0, and extract it in this directory. Get the sdk from http://urbanairship.com/resources/developer-resources
- The binding dll should build only with that.
- To build and run the samples, you need to set some required service API
  settings in "Assets/airshipconfig.properties" in each project.
  This is exactly the same steps to configure Java-based Android UAirship
  projects, so see Urban Airship documentation (you will have to read
  their documentation to properly setup the server side anyways).

Building and running the applications doesn't mean it's finished. You
should try sending push messages via urbanairship.com server.

Warning: InstrumentedActivity
-----------------------------

There are two samples that are ported from Urban Airship samples (licensed
under Apache 2). One is PushSample and the other is RichPushSample.
While the purpose look similar, they have different activity models in
Java code. However, for PushSample, its InstrumentedActivity approach
crashed due to some application initialization glitch, and we had to
use our own Android.App.Application class that initializes UAirship
in an appropriate timing before the activity tries to actually use it.

The same problem would happen when you are to write your own application.

On the other hand, RichPushSample is almost pure C# porting.
