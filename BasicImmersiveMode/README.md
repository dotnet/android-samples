# Basic Immersive Mode

Android 4.4 introduces a way for you to provide a more immersive
screen experience in your app, by letting users show or hide
the status bar and navigation bar with a swipe.

This sample demonstrates how to enable and disable this feature programmatically.

See the `Advanced Immersive Mode` sample for more details.
