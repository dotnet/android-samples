CocosSharp Empty Project for Android
====================================

This project serves as a starting-point for CocosSharp Android projects.  It is the result of working through the Part 2 - Creating Android CocosSharp Project walkthrough.  It is titled BouncingGame as that is the name of the project created by the full Introduction to CocosSharp walkthrough.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for Android and one cross-platform portable class library.

When executed this project displays only a black screen.
