Maps and Location Demo
======================

This is the sample code for the [Maps and Location article](http://docs.xamarin.com/android/tutorials/Maps_and_Location). The code in this project is for the [Google Maps for Android v1](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/v1/), which was officially deprecated on December 2, 2012.  

Applications will continue to work with the Google Maps v1 API, but as of March 18, 2013 Google will not issue any more API keys for the is version of Google Maps. This example is being kept for reference purposes for those who may already have API keys for Google Maps v1.

If you want to incorporate Google Maps in your Xamarin.Android application you should refer to the [Maps And Location Demo v2](https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples/tree/master/MapsAndLocationDemo_v2) and the documentation for [Google Maps for Android v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/).
