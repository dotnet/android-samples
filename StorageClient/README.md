# Storage Client
This sample demonstrates how to use the ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT
intent to let users choose a file via the system's file browser. 
This intent allows a client application to access a list of 
document providers on the device, and choose a file from any of them.

Installing this sample alongside `Storage Provider` allows this sample
to access our own document provider in addition to the others on device.
