# AsyncImageAndroid

This sample application demonstrates how to use the new Async/Await feature which is available in Xamarin.Android 4.8.

The sample download a large image from Internet using the DownloadDataTaskAsync in WebClient. Saving and resizing the image also use the new async feature.

Note: Will not work with AOT + armeabi configuration.
