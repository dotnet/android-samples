# Hello World (Publishing)

This is a simple hello world type application to that goes along with 
the Xamarin topic 
[Publishing an Application](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/publishing_an_application/). 

This project contains a sample keystore called `xample.keystore`. This 
keystore is only for demonstration purposes. Do not use it for anything 
other thank example purposes. The password is `password`, and the 
keystore contains one key named `publishingdoc` with the password of 
`password`.
