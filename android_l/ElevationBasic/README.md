Elevation Basic
==============

This sample demonstrates two alternative ways to move a view in the z-axis. The first view has a fixed elevation using XML and the second one is raised when the user taps on it, using TranslationZ = (int).  

This layering is part of Android's new [Material Design](https://developer.android.com/preview/material/index.html)
