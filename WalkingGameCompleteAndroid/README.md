# MonoGame WalkingGame Project for Android

This is a small demo game using MonoGame for Android.  It is the result of working through the the entire Introduction to Monogame walkthrough.

This single solution contains two projects:  one for Android and one cross-platform portable class library.

The demo can be played by touching the screen to move the character around the screen.
