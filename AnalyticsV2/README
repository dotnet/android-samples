How to build the entire package from source
===========================================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Android SDK.
  - Environment variable ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/the/sdk

Build steps
-----------

- Create docs directory.
- From $ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/analytics_sdk_v2/ directory,
  - copy libGoogleAnalyticsV2.jar to AnalyticsV2/Jars.
  - copy javadocs.zip to docs and extract it there. (actually no need to copy)

Then you can build the project as usual.
