Java Native Invoke Sample
=========================

This sample shows how to manually bind to a Java library so it can
be consumed by a Mono for Android application.

Requirements
------------

There is one requirement in order to build and run this sample:

 1. Mono for Android Preiew 13 or later.

Commands that need to be executed are indicated within backtics (`),
and $ANDROID_SDK_PATH is the directory that contains your Android SDK
installation.

How it works
------------

As Mono for Android 1.0 does not support binding arbitrary .jar
files (only the Android SDK android.jar is bound), alternative
mechanisms must instead used for interoperation between Java and
managed code.  Two primary mechanisms are:

 1. Android.Runtime.JNIEnv for creating instances of Java objects and
    invoking methods on them from C#.  This is very similar to
    System.Reflection in that everything is string based and thus
    untyped at compile time.

 2. The ability to include Java source code and .jar files into the
    resulting Android application.

We will be using mechanism (2) in order to demonstrate the Jave Native Invoke capability.

The Java source code is kept in MyActivity.java, which is included
in the project with a Build Action of AndroidJavaSource.

Furthermore, we edit Properties\AndroidManifest.xml so that it
contains one additional element:

1. A /manifest/application/activity element must be created so that
    we can use Context.StartActivity() to create the custom activity.

This translates to having the following XML within
AndroidManifest.xml:

	<application android:label="Managed Maps">
		<uses-library android:name="com.google.android.maps" />
		<activity android:name="mono.samples.jnitest.MyActivity" />
	</application>
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

MyActivity.java uses the Resources\Layout\HelloWorld.axml resource, which
contains a LinearLayout with a Button and a TextView.

Activity1.cs uses Java.Lang.Class.FindClass() to obtain a
Java.Lang.Class instance for the custom MyActivity type, then we
create an Intent to pass to Activity.StartActivity() to launch
MyActivity.
