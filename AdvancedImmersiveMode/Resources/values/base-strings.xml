            \"Immersive Mode\" is a new UI mode which improves \"hide full screen\" and
            \"hide nav bar\" modes, by letting users swipe the bars in and out.  This sample
            lets the user experiment with immersive mode by enabling it and seeing how it interacts
            with some of the other UI flags related to full-screen apps.
            \n\nThis sample also lets the user choose between normal immersive mode and "sticky"
            immersive mode, which removes the status bar and nav bar
            a few seconds after the user has swiped them back in.
