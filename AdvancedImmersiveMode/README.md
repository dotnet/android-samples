Advanced Immersive Mode
==================
Android 4.4 introduces a way for you to provide a more immersive 
screen experience in your app, by letting users show or hide 
the status bar and navigation bar with a swipe.

This sample demonstrates how this feature interacts with some 
of the other UI flags related to full-screen apps. The sample 
also shows how to implement a "sticky" mode, which re-hides 
the bars a few seconds after the user swipes them back in.
