AppShortcuts Sample
===================

This sample demonstrates how to use the Launcher Shortcuts API introduced in Android 7.1 (API 25). This API allows an application to define a set of Intents which are displayed as when a user long-presses on the app's launcher icon. Examples are given for registering both links both statically in XML, as well as dynamically at runtime.

Instructions
------------

You can use the shortcuts feature in Android 7.1 (API 25) to bring users from the launcher directly to key actions within your app. Users simply long-press your app's launcher icon to reveal the app's shortcuts, then tap on a shortcut to jump to the associated action. These shortcuts are a great way to engage users, and they let you surface the functionality of your app even before users launch your app.


Build Requirements
------------------
Using this sample requires the Android 7.1 (API 25) and the Xamarin.Android 7.1.99 or higher.
