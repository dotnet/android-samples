CommitContentSampleApp Sample
===========================

This sample demonstrates how to write an application which accepts rich content (such as images) sent from a keyboard using the Commit Content API.

Instructions
------------

Users often want to communicate with emojis, stickers, and other kinds of rich content. In previous versions of Android, soft keyboards (input method editors or IMEs) could send only unicode emoji to apps. For rich content (such as images), apps had to either build app-specific APIs that couldn't be used in other apps or use workarounds like sending images through the Easy Share Action or the clipboard.


Build Requirements
------------------
Using this sample requires the Android 7.1 (API 25) and the Xamarin.Android 7.1.99 or higher.
