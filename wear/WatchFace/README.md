# WatchFace 

**WatchFace** is a sample app that accompanies the article,
[Creating a Watch Face](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/wear/creating-a-watchface/).

This sample demonstrates how to use `CanvasWatchFaceService` and 
`CanvasWatchFaceService.Engine` to implement a custom Android Wear 
watch face. This analog-style watch face sports an hour hand, a minute 
hand, and a seconds hand; it also handles changes between ambient mode 
and interactive mode. A time zone receiver listens for time zone 
changes and updates the time as needed. 

The watch face service is packaged with a very simple app that is used 
only as a packaging vehicle for getting the watch face service into the 
Wear device (the app doesn't interact with the watch face). 

To run the watch face: 

1.  Build and deploy the solution to the Wear device.

2.  Swipe right until you the default watch face appears.

3.  Press down for a second to enter the watch face picker
    (alternately, you can enter **Setup** and tap **Change watch face**).

4.  Swipe until you see the **Xamarin Sample** watch face.

5.  Tap to select the **Xamarin Sample** watch face.

Note that this app depends on the
[Xamarin Android Wear Support Libraries](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.Wear).

This sample was ported from the Java **WatchFace** sample described in the Android Developer 
[Drawing Watch Faces](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/drawing.html)
topic.
