# GridViewPager sample
This sample demonstrates how to use the GridViewPager and GridPagerAdapter view for Android Wear devices. 

GridViewPager is a view that separates each item onto a different page, and can be swiped through horizontally or vertically. An implementation of GridViewAdapter is included to supply the GridViewPager with views.

GridViewPager is very similar to the notifications layout on the Android Wear home screen. As such, each page / item may have a background, and the control will automatically perform parallax effects between the foreground and background.

## Build Requirements
Xamarin Studio 5.3+  
Xamarin.Android 4.17+
