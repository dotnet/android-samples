        accommodate extra content. Tall cards can be scrolled through
        like any scrollable view. The maximum height is controlled by
        setExpansionFactor() with a default of 10 pages. After that
        you\'ll notice a faded edge to indicate there is more. Expansion
        can be disabled completely using setExpansionEnabled(false).

        page.</string>
