Jumping Jack
==================
This sample demonstrates the use of the gravity sensor in the Android Wear device through a counter for jumping jacks that the user makes while wearing the device. Note: the jumping jacks must be fairly quick (2 seconds or less) for the jumping jacks to count. The counter can be reset from the settings screen accessed by swiping left.

Instructions
------------
* Deploy the wearable project onto an Android Wear device.
* The first page will count the number of jumping jacks you do.
* The second page (reached by swiping left) will contain a button allowing you to reset the counter.

Build Requirements
------------------
Xamarin Studio 5.3+
