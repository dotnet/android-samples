#Speed Tracker Sample

This sample uses the FusedLocation APIs of Google Play Services on those devices that have a hardware GPS built in. In those cases, this sample provides a simple screen that shows the current speed of the device on the watch. User can set a speed limit and if the speed approaches that limit, it changes the color to yellow and if it exceeds the limit, it turns red. User can also enable recording of coordinates and when it pairs back with the phone, this data will be synced with the phone component of the app and user can see a track made of those coordinates on a map on the phone.
