Android Wear
============================

This folder contains Android Wear samples.

Many Wear samples contain both a handheld (phone) and Wear project.  
When using an emulator to run the Wear project, you must run:
```
adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601
```
For further information, refer to [Android Developer](http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/creating.html#SetupEmulator).
