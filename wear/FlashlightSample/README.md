# Flashlight
This sample demonstrates how to create something similar to a flashlight on an android wear device by changing the color of the screen to a flat white color. This also includes a “party light” which can be accessed by swiping left which would replace the flat white color with a flashing cycle of many colors.

## Instructions
* The default page is a white light
* Swipe left to change to the party light which cycles through many colors

## Build Requirements
Xamarin.Android 4.17+  
Xamarin Studio 5.3+
