This solution uses the Google Play Services (Froyo) component to demonstrate a few uses of
the maps API included within Google Play Services.

Note that this solution WILL NOT BUILD until the component is reloaded by opening this solution
within Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio. You will also need to add your own Google Maps API key
in the Android Manifest.xml file for this sample to run correctly.

For information on obtaining a Google Maps API key, see
