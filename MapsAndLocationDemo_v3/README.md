# Google Maps v2 Demo

This code provides an example of how to use Google Maps v2 in an
Android application. The **SimpleMapDemo** project demonstrates the
basic features of Google Maps for Android v2. It requires the Google
Play Services client library, and it is designed to run on API 23
devices and later.

Please see the Xamarin.Android guide [Using the Google Maps API in your application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/platform/maps-and-location/maps/maps-api) for details on how to run this sample.


The **LocationDemo** project that was previously part of
**MapsAndLocationDemo\_v3** is obsolete and has been removed from the
solution. For an example of gathering location data,
see the [FusedLocationProvider](https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/monodroid/FusedLocationProvider/)
code example.
