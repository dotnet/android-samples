        layout parameters. GridLayout works like LinearLayout in this case;
        putting all the components either in a single row or in a single column -
        depending on the value of this flag. In the horizontal case, a columnCount
        property may be additionally supplied to force new rows to be created when a
        row is full. The rowCount attribute may be used similarly in the vertical case.
        The default is horizontal.
