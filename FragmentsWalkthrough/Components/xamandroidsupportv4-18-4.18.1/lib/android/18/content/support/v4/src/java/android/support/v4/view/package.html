Support android.util classes to assist with development of applications for
android API level 4 or later.  The main features here are a variety of classes
for handling backwards compatibility with views (for example
{@link android.support.v4.view.MotionEventCompat} allows retrieving multi-touch
data if available), and a new
{@link android.support.v4.view.ViewPager} widget (which at some point should be moved over
to the widget package).
