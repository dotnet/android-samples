Support android.content classes to assist with development of applications for
android API level 4 or later.  The main features here are
{@link android.support.v4.content.Loader} and related classes and
{@link android.support.v4.content.LocalBroadcastManager} to
provide a cleaner implementation of broadcasts that don't need to go outside
of an app.
