/**
 * Helper for the common pattern of implementing a {@link BroadcastReceiver}
 * that receives a device wakeup event and then passes the work off
 * to a {@link android.app.Service}, while ensuring that the
 * device does not go back to sleep during the transition.
 *
 * <p>This class takes care of creating and managing a partial wake lock
 * for you; you must request the {@link android.Manifest.permission#WAKE_LOCK}
 * permission to use it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 *
 * <p>A {@link WakefulBroadcastReceiver} uses the method
 * {@link WakefulBroadcastReceiver#startWakefulService startWakefulService()}
 * to start the service that does the work. This method is comparable to
 * {@link android.content.Context#startService startService()}, except that
 * the {@link WakefulBroadcastReceiver} is holding a wake lock when the service
 * starts. The intent that is passed with
 * {@link WakefulBroadcastReceiver#startWakefulService startWakefulService()}
 * holds an extra identifying the wake lock.</p>
 *
 * {@sample development/samples/Support4Demos/src/com/example/android/supportv4/content/SimpleWakefulReceiver.java complete}
 *
 * <p>The service (in this example, an {@link android.app.IntentService}) does
 * some work. When it is finished, it releases the wake lock by calling
 * {@link WakefulBroadcastReceiver#completeWakefulIntent
 * completeWakefulIntent(intent)}. The intent it passes as a parameter
 * is the same intent that the {@link WakefulBroadcastReceiver} originally
 * passed in.</p>
