{"Name":"Android Support Library v4","Id":437,"Alias":"xamandroidsupportv4-18","Description":"The Android Support Library package is a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries\u0027 features and still be compatible with devices running old android flavors.\n\nIncluding the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users.\n\nChanges for v4 support library Rev 18:\n\n**User interface**\n\n- Added BidiFormatter for handling text strings that combine right to left and left to right-formatted text.\n- Modified ViewPager to better handle cases where the pager has a measured width of zero in the initial layout processing.\n- Modified DrawerLayout and SlidingPaneLayout to not throw exceptions for measurement while the project code is being edited.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\n- Added ExploreByTouchHelper to simplify the implementation of accessibility for custom views.\n- Fixed a problem with ViewPager incorrectly populating TYPE_VIEW_SCROLLED accessibility events.\n- Fixed a null pointer exception in ViewPager when populating an accessibility event.\n- Simplified AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat by changing CharSequence inputs to String objects.\n- Deprecated an AccessibilityRecordCompat constructor that used an Object as input.\n\n**Media**\n\n- Added TransportMediator helper class to manage media transport control, such as play, pause, skip and other media actions.\n- Added DisplayManagerCompat for managing display output to one or more device displays.\n\n**Other changes**\n\n- Added WakefulBroadcastReceiver helper class for implementing a common pattern of detecting a device wakeup event and passing work off to a Service while ensuring that the device does not go back to sleep before the handoff is complete.\n- Added two new APIs, commitContentChanged() and rollbackContentChanged(), to AsyncTaskLoader to help deal with background updates for data changes that are subsequently canceled.\n\n*Portions of this page are modifications based on [work][3] created and [shared by the Android Open Source Project][1] and used according to terms described in the [Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution License][2].*\n\n[1]: http://code.google.com/policies.html\n[2]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/\n[3]: http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html\n\t\n","Version":"4.18.1","Summary":"Provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.","QuickStart":"v4 Support Library Rev 18\n=========================\n\nThis library is designed to be used with Android 1.6 (API level 4) and higher. It includes the largest set of APIs compared to the other libraries, including support for application components, user interface features, accessibility, data handling, network connectivity, and programming utilities. Here are a few of the key classes included in the v4 library:\n\n**App Components**\n\n- Fragment - Adds support encapsulation of user interface and functionality with Fragments, enabling applications provide layouts that adjust between small and large-screen devices.\n- NotificationCompat - Adds support for rich notification features.\n- LocalBroadcastManager - Allows applications to easily register for and receive intents within a single application without broadcasting them globally.\n\n**User Interface**\n\n- ViewPager - Adds a ViewGroup that manages the layout for the child views, which the user can swipe between.\n- PagerTitleStrip - Adds a non-interactive title strip, that can be added as a child of ViewPager.\n- PagerTabStrip - Adds a navigation widget for switching between paged views, that can also be used with ViewPager.\n- DrawerLayout - Adds support for creating a Navigation Drawer that can be pulled in from the edge of a window.\n- SlidingPaneLayout - Adds widget for creating linked summary and detail views that appropriately adapt to various screen sizes.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\n- ExploreByTouchHelper - Adds a helper class for implementing accessibility support for custom views.\n- AccessibilityEventCompat - Adds support for AccessibilityEvent. For more information about implementing accessibility, see Accessibility.\n- AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat - Adds support for AccessibilityNodeInfo.\n- AccessibilityNodeProviderCompat - Adds support for AccessibilityNodeProvider.\n- AccessibilityDelegateCompat - Adds support for View.AccessibilityDelegate.\n\n**Content**\n\n- Loader - Adds support for asynchronous loading of data. The library also provides concrete implementations of this class, including CursorLoader and AsyncTaskLoader.\n- FileProvider - Adds support for sharing of private files between applications.\n\t\nThere are many other APIs included in this library.
