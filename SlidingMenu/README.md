SlidingMenu Binding
===================

This is an example of how to create bindings for a .jar file using a Java Binding Project in Mono for Android.  This example creates a binding for [SlidingMenu](https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu) by [Jeremy Feinstein](https://github.com/jfeinstein10).

It includes a very crude, example of the binding in action. We would gladly welcome pull requests showing a better example. :)

SlidingMenu requires [ActionbarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/). In this project we just add the `jar` file from Actionbar Sherlock as an `EmbeddedReferenceJar` to the binding file.
