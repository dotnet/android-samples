# Visual Game Controller
This AndroidTV sample demonstrates the use of input from a game controller by displaying input events on the screen on a virtual controller as they happen.

## Instructions
* Press buttons and move axes on an attached game controller and the input that you give will be recreated on-screen.
* Keep in mind that the button mapping is different for different types of game controllers. The sample has the differences between Xbox game controllers and Android game controllers in the comments as the item in question is drawn.

## Build Requirements
Using this sample requires an android tv or android l device and Xamarin.Android version 4.17 or later.
