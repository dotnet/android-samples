android-mapviewballoons
=======================

**Note:** This project is for the older Android Maps API v1 which has been deprecated.  It will not work with Android Maps API v2.

This project contains the binding for the Android Library Project [android-mapviewballons](https://github.com/jgilfelt/android-mapviewballoons). 

The directory `android-mapviewballoons` holds the Java source code. 

The directory `mfa-mapviewballoons` holds the actual binding. Due to licensing restrictions, you must add in the Google API for Maps to the binding project yourself.  Copy `maps.jar` for API Level 8 into the folder `mfa-mapviewballoons/Jars` and change the build action of the file to `ReferenceJar`. ***Until this file is copied in, the Java Binding Library project will not compile***.

The folder `mfa-mapviewballoons-example` holds a sample Mono for Android application demonstrating the use of the binding. It will be necessary to update the file `mfa-mapviewballoons-example/Resources/Layout/main.axml` with a [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/android/maps-api-signup).
