BatchStepSensor
=============
This sample demonstrates how to set up and use Android 4.4's step counting APIs with batching (letting the system collect multiple step events before returning them to the application.)

How to Build and Run this Sample
==========================
To build, install Xamarin Studio or Xamarin for Visual Studio, open the project in your selected IDE and build. In order to fully use this sample, you should deploy to a device that had step counting sensors.

This sample requires Android 4.4 (KitKat).
