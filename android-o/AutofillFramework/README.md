AutofillFramework Sample
========================

This sample demonstrates the use of the Autofill Framework. It includes implementations of client Activities with views that should be autofilled, and a Service that can provide autofill data to client Activities.

Instructions
------------

To set the device's default Autofill service to the one in the sample, edit Settings > System > Languages & Input > Advanced > Auto-fill service and select the sample app. To edit the service's settings, tap the settings icon next to the Auto-fill service list item or open the Autofill Settings launcher icon.. Here, you can set whether you want to enable authentication on the entire autofill Response or just on individual autofill datasets. You should also set the master password to “unlock” authenticated autofill data with.


Build Requirements
------------------
Using this sample requires the Android 8.0 (API 26) and the Xamarin.Android 8.0 or higher.
