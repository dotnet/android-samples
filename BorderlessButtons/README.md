Borderless Buttons
==================

This sample demonstrates the **borderless button** styling from the Holo visual language.
The most interesting bits in this sample are in the layout files (res/layout/).

See [borderless buttons](http://developer.android.com/design/building-blocks/buttons.html#borderless) at the Android Design guide for a discussion of this visual style.

Based on the Google Android-18 sample "BorderlessButtons".
